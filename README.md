# Fatalities in the ISR-PSE Conflict 2000-2023

"Dive into our analysis of the ISR-PSE conflict fatalities from 2000-2023. This project sheds light on the human cost through data visualization and trend analysis, aiming to inform and foster peace. Join us in understanding this profound issue."

## Project Overview

This project seeks to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze the fatalities in the Israel-Palestine conflict from 2000 to 2023. Our objective is to uncover patterns, correlations, and possibly predictive insights that could contribute to resolving the conflict and preventing future loss of life. We believe that every life lost is a collective failure of humanity, and through this work, we hope to contribute towards a future where peace prevails.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fatalities_isr_pse_conflict_2000_to_2023.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Explore the Notebooks**: Navigate to the `notebooks` directory to find Jupyter notebooks with detailed analyses and models.

## Implementation

- **Data Collection**: We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of fatalities from various sources, ensuring accuracy and relevance.
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Through statistical analysis and machine learning models, we have identified key factors that contribute to escalations in violence.
- **Deep Learning Predictions**: Using deep learning, we aim to predict potential hotspots and times of increased conflict, offering insights for preemptive actions to reduce fatalities.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from data scientists, peace activists, and anyone passionate about using technology for social good. Here's how you can help:
- **Data**: Contribute additional data sources or improvements to the dataset.
- **Models**: Enhance existing models or propose new ones for better predictions.
- **Insights**: Share your analyses or interpretations that could help in understanding and resolving the conflict.
