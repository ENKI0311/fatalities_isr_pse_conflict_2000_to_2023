# Fatalities in the ISR-PSE Conflict 2000-2023

## Overview
This project analyzes fatalities from the Israel-Palestine conflict between 2000 and 2023. Through data visualization, machine learning, and deep learning, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that could contribute to a better understanding of the conflict's human cost. Our ultimate goal is to foster informed discussions and pave the way for solutions that promote peace.

## Workflow and Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple reliable sources, focusing on:
  - Fatalities categorized by **year**, **region**, and **type of violence**.
  - Key variables such as **age**, **gender**, **incident type**, and **geolocation**.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned and transformed the data for consistency and accuracy.
- Handled missing values and standardized formats across datasets.
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features like **incident type** and **region**.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conducted a thorough analysis of trends and distributions.
- Visualized:
  - Annual fatalities.
  - Geographic hotspots of violence.
  - Demographic breakdowns by age and gender.

### 4. **Model Development**
- **Machine Learning Models**: Identified factors contributing to escalations in violence using models like:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Deep Learning Models**: Developed predictive models using:
  - LSTMs for temporal patterns.
  - Fully connected neural networks for classification.

### 5. **Evaluation**
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for classification tasks.
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score for regression tasks.

## Results and Insights
- Identified key drivers of conflict escalations, such as **geopolitical events** and **specific regions prone to violence**.
- Generated predictive models with promising accuracy for identifying potential hotspots and periods of increased risk.
- Visualizations provided valuable insights into long-term trends and demographic patterns of the conflict.
